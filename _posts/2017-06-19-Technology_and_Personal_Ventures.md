Today, some organizational and internal turmoil reminded me that I am not as settled in my position as I necessarily assume. There is, at the drop of a hat, always the opportunity to move to a different position, or find some new project for which my current toolset is not the best solution. For all I know, I could be asked to help write control software for an Android based piece of hardware tomorrow, or find myself knee-deep in a full application rewrite next month.

So instead of being settled, comfortable, one might even say _lazy_, I've decided to at least dip a toe in the waters of some programming languages and frameworks that I've not yet encountered. To start, I'll be working my way through the [Kotlin Koans](https://try.kotlinlang.org), then perhaps even stretching myself into the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) exercises.

On a more personal note, my family and I have spent an exorbitant amount of time preparing my prior house to put on the market to sell. We've finally reached the point that the finishing touches are being put on things, like final paint touch-ups and getting photos shot for the listing, with an open house planned for next weekend. I'm ever hopeful that we've covered the biggest ticket items and anything that comes up for inspections or the buyer's demands are nominal and can be handled by hiring someone for petty cash. Regardless, the stress and added overhead of selling a house has, and continues, to take its toll on my family. I'm hoping we can shed this burden as soon as possible and get back to being a happy one-house-owned family.

With any luck, I'll sneak some time between all the craziness to work on personal projects, learn Kotlin, and keep making myself better. Until next time,
