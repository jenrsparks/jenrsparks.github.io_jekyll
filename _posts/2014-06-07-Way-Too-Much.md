title: Way Too Much
categories: [updates]

It occurs to me; I do way too much. Take this week for instance: I worked extra a few extra hours, brewed after the sun went down, spent some hours rehabbing this site, and even beta testing a new version of a mobile game. That said, I've been considering the kinds of things I want to talk about here, and it's far more broad than simply programming. Here are a few of the things I'll hope to be discussing here:

* Programming Theory &amp; Application
* Beer Brewing
* Video &amp; Tabletop Games
* Knitting & Crochet
* Random Personal Projects

I think a fair goal for myself is to pick something to post about, every week - hopefully something new I've learned, or some new technique. At the least, I'll go for a progress update on one of the various in-work projects, but I'm going to set a personal expectation of making it more about what I've learned through that progress.

With that, I have a family to help move, so I'd better get moving!
