It's been a while, to say the least. Three years, as a matter of fact. I had big plans for this place - projects, a dumping ground for programming exploration and demos and typographical experimentation.

I've taken the first pass at some cleanup, and I've now got the site running locally for me in Docker. It's going to be a lot easier to keep up with the maintenance aspect, at least. Writing content, on the other hand, is another challenge, but with any luck, I'll dig up my old project list and get things moving again.
