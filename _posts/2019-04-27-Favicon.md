OK, I realize I just posted, but I'm having way too much fun getting this cleaned up with some of the finer touches. I decided to get myself a proper favicon for the website, and happily found myself at [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). It turns out, they've got the same fonts available as [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/), making it extremely easy to create an icon that matches the site.

Really easily, I simply chose the text for the icon ('S' is for Sparks folks), then chose colors that matched the theming of the site. In this case, `#ac4142` is our sidebar color, and `#ebd1d1` is the color that the sidebar text shows up with. I picked my matching font - [Cinzel Decorative](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Cinzel+Decorative) - set the background to 'circle,' and played around with the font size until I landed at the perfect alignment for the letter against the circle.

Here's our result: ![android-chrome](/public/android-chrome-192x192.png)

Honestly, the absolute hardest part of this whole thing was getting the images scp'd over to the Codenvy site, which it turns out is because I set my port flag to `-p` instead of `-P`.
