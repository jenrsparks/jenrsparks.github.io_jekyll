Over the last 6 years I've worked in the I.T. industry, I've often wanted to share the lessons I've learned, but never had an outlet to share these lessons. In an attempt to change this, I'm kicking off this site with the hopes of writing about the types of things I encounter, both previously and moving forward.

I look forward to the chance to share what I learn, and with any luck, people can save themselves some time, too.

Until next time,
