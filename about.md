## A Few Words

Defining myself as an engineer has finally become comfortable, but at heart I am a creator, a problem solver, and a perfectionist. I constantly enjoy finding new challenges, and I often look back to prior solutions with an eye to improve them.

As many will tell you, I have a wonderful husband and fantastic, unique, incredible children. We have too many cats; our household is constantly filled with the sound of laughter, chaos, and discovery.
